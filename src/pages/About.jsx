                    <b>Sanatana Dharma Foundation,</b> a revered non-profit
                    organization dedicated to the propagation and preservation
                    of Sanatana Dharma, often known as<b> Hinduism</b>. Grounded in the
                    profound wisdom of ancient Indian traditions, our foundation
                    embodies the aims articulated in our <b>Trust Deed</b>, promoting a
                    renaissance of religious and cultural values across
                    communities while nurturing a deeper understanding of <b>Hindu
                    philosophy</b>. At the heart of the <b>Sanatana Dharma Foundation</b>{" "}
                     lies the concept of <b>social reincarnation of Sanatana Dharma</b>.
                    Our mission is to provide a contemporary approach to
                    <b>religious and ethical training</b>, tailored to cater to the
                    evolving needs of our society. Our principles are rooted in
                    the <b>liberal, wide and unsectarian nature</b> of the Sanatana
                    Dharma. We are an organization that is passionate about
                    collaborating with individuals who hold their national
                    identity in high regard and take pride in being a follower
                    of Sanatana Dharma. In recent years, we have witnessed an
                    erosion of <b>Indian culture</b> due to the overwhelming influence
                    of the West. Elements which once were a perennial source of
                    pride for all Indians have faced marginalization,
                    particularly the deep-rooted values of Sanatana Dharma. As a
                    foundation, we are profoundly committed to <b>reviving this
