    <h1 className="items-center p-1 mt-5 mb-5 text-justify rounded-sm">The Inception of the Sanatana Dharma Foundation revolves around the idea of social reincarnation of the Sanatana Dharma. 
    Our objective is to provide religious and ethical training suited to the needs of the time.
     It is necessary that this religious and ethical training shall be of a wide, liberal and unsectarian character, inclusive enough to unite the most divergent forms of Sanatana thought. Our organisation is keen on working with like- minded people who value their national identity and take pride in being a follower of Sanatana Dharma. We aim to work efficiently towards our goal of uprooting anti-national ideas and elements which pose a threat to national solidarity. 
     Over the past few years, Indian culture has become marginalized due to western influences. The hyperbole of western practices has degraded the stature of Sanatana Dharma, which used to be a perennial source of pride for all Indians. 
     This Foundation is dedicated to resurrecting the most ancient Dharma of the world. With the aim of reinstating righteousness and integrity among our fellow Indians, we are working tediously to unite the people of India in a common thread of love, unity and mutual trust. The fundamental principles of religion, governing the general view of life and life's obligations, are alone sufficient to restore the cultural wealth of this ancient sect. Our organization is leaving no stone unturned to unite Indians in a common faith by excluding all the elements that divide them. 
     This will lead to the revival of our revered Sanatana culture, not as a religion, but as an ancient school of beliefs which will cater to the needs and rights of all the citizens of Bharat, irrespective of any religious or cultural bias.</h1>
