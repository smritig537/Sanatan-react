          Sanatana Dharma, meaning "eternal duty" or "eternal law," is the
          spiritual and philosophical foundation of Hinduism. It is not just a
          religion but a way of life, embracing a rich tapestry of beliefs,
          customs, and practices that have evolved over millennia. At its core,
          Sanatana Dharma teaches the eternal principles of righteousness,
          morality, duty, and cosmic order. Central to Sanatana Dharma is the
          concept of dharma, which encompasses the duties, responsibilities, and
          moral obligations that individuals must uphold in their lives. Dharma
          guides individuals in living harmoniously with themselves, others, and
          the universe.
