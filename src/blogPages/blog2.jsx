                  Hinduism, one of the most ancient and diverse religions in the

                  The Vedas are the oldest and most respected scriptures in
                  Hinduism, believed to have been composed over three millennia
                  ago. These texts, known as “Shruti,” meaning “that which is
                  heard,” are considered to be divinely revealed to ancient
                  sages, or rishis. The Vedas are divided into four main
                  collections: Rig Veda, Sama Veda, Yajur Veda, and Atharva
                  Veda.

                  The Vedas cover a vast array of knowledge, encompassing hymns,
                  rituals, and philosophical discussions. They explore the
                  nature of the universe, the roles of deities, and the
                  principles of dharma (righteousness). For example, the Rig
                  Veda is rich in hymns dedicated to various deities, while the
                  Yajur Veda is centered around sacrificial rituals. The Sama
                  Veda is renowned for its musical chants, and the Atharva Veda
                  contains spells and incantations meant for daily life.

                  Composed between 800 and 200 BCE, the Upanishads are a
                  collection of philosophical texts that probe the deeper
                  spiritual meanings of the Vedas. As the final part of the
                  Vedas, they are often referred to as Vedanta, which means "the
                  end of the Vedas."

                  The Upanishads explore profound questions about the nature of
                  reality, the self (atman), and the ultimate reality (Brahman).
                  They emphasize the unity between the individual soul and the
                  universal soul, and the importance of achieving
                  self-realization. Core concepts like karma (action and its
                  consequences), samsara (the cycle of rebirth), and moksha
                  (liberation) are central to their teachings.

                  The Bhagavad Gita, often simply called the Gita, is a
                  700-verse scripture that forms part of the Indian epic
                  Mahabharata. It takes the form of a conversation between
                  Prince Arjuna and the god Krishna, who acts as his charioteer,
                  set on the battlefield of Kurukshetra just before a major war.

                  teachings on duty (dharma), righteousness, and the nature of
                  reality. The Gita outlines various paths to spiritual
                  realization, such as Karma Yoga (the path of selfless action),
                  Bhakti Yoga (the path of devotion), and Jnana Yoga (the path
