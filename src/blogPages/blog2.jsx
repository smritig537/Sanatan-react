                  considered to be divinely revealed to ancient sages, or
                  rishis. The <strong>Vedas</strong> are divided into four main

                  The <strong>Vedas</strong> cover a vast array of knowledge,
                  encompassing hymns, rituals, and philosophical discussions.
                  They explore the nature of the universe, the roles of deities,
                  and the principles of dharma (righteousness). For example, the
                  Rig Veda is rich in hymns dedicated to various deities, while
                  the Yajur Veda is centered around sacrificial rituals. The
                  Sama Veda is renowned for its musical chants, and the Atharva
                  Veda contains spells and incantations meant for daily life.

                  Composed between 800 and 200 BCE, the{" "}
                  <strong>Upanishads</strong> are a collection of philosophical
                  texts that probe the deeper spiritual meanings of the{" "}
                  <strong>Vedas</strong>. As the final part of the
                  <strong>Vedas</strong>, they are often referred to as Vedanta,
                  which means "the end of the <strong>Vedas</strong>."

                <h3 className="text-2xl text-left font-bold py-4">Teachings</h3>
                <p>
                  The <strong>Upanishads</strong> explore profound questions
                  about the nature of reality, the self (atman), and the
                  ultimate reality (Brahman). They emphasize the unity between
                  the individual soul and the universal soul, and the importance
                  of achieving self-realization. Core concepts like karma
                  (action and its consequences), samsara (the cycle of rebirth),
                  and moksha (liberation) are central to their teachings.

                  The philosophical insights of the <strong>Upanishads</strong>{" "}
                  continue to shape Hindu thought and practice. They inspire
                  those seeking truth and offer a framework for understanding
                  the spiritual journey. Their focus on meditation,

                  The <strong>Bhagavad Gita</strong>, often simply called the
                  Gita, is a 700-verse scripture that forms part of the Indian
                  epic Mahabharata. It takes the form of a conversation between
                  Prince Arjuna and the god Krishna, who acts as his charioteer,
                  set on the battlefield of Kurukshetra just before a major war.

                  The <strong>Bhagavad Gita</strong> addresses the moral and
                  philosophical dilemmas that Arjuna faces. Krishna provides
                  profound teachings on duty (dharma), righteousness, and the
                  nature of reality. The Gita outlines various paths to
                  spiritual realization, such as Karma Yoga (the path of
                  selfless action), Bhakti Yoga (the path of devotion), and
                  Jnana Yoga (the path of knowledge).
