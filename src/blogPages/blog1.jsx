                The <strong>Sanatana Dharma Foundation</strong> stands as a guiding light for
                ancient knowledge and contemporary principles with a focus on
                reviving and advocating for <strong>Sanatana Dharma</strong> beliefs and
                practices. It has established a footing in key <strong>Indian urban
                centers</strong> like Delhi, where its headquarters is located along with
                branches in Chennai, Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Indore. The

                Our Mission and Vision
              </h2>
              <p>
                The <strong>Sanatana Dharma Foundation</strong> aims to offer moral education
                that meets the current requirements of society while combating
                the impact of Western influences that have marginalized <strong>Indian
                traditions</strong>. The foundation's goal is to rejuvenate and uphold
                the principles of righteousness and integrity to foster mutual
                trust among individuals. We aspire to bring various aspects of
                <strong>Sanatana Dharma</strong> with a shared belief system that goes beyond
                religious and cultural  prejudices.
              </p>

                and cherish their cultural heritage as adherents of <strong>Sanatana
                Dharma</strong>. Our goal is to revitalize the richness and solidarity of
                our country through a range of projects. We focus on removing
                elements that create divisions and promoting a shared belief
                that transcends cultural differences.
